00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,380
Autoreg Pro has been updated to version 3.68. There are many improvements, but the most exciting one is the new automatic skirt setup.

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,360
So in this video, we'll focus on the skirt rig. I'll show you how to set it up and how to use it. It is very easy.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,320
In fact, I would say that this is the easiest way to create a bone rig for a skirt in Blender.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:31,120
If you're interested in the other new features, you can find out all of them on the official Autoreg Pro documentation page.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,400
So here is my character model wearing a skirt. I have the skirt as a separate object.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,940
You can join them into a single object if you prefer, but this just makes my life a little bit easier.

7
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:49,720
For the basic human rig, I'm going to select the character, expand the end panel, go to ARP, and go to the Smart Features,

8
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,740
Get Selected Objects, and press OK.

9
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,900
Then, as usual, I'll add the neck, chin, shoulders, and so on.

10
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,400
And press Go.

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,260
At this point, you should check your fingers alignment.

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,540
I can play around with the settings for the automatic finger alignment,

13
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,980
or I can just align the fingers manually as I'm doing right now.

14
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,740
Now, I can press Much To Rig.

15
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,640
So we are here for the skirt, so let's see how we can add the skirt setup to this rig.

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,720
If I click on Add Limb at the bottom, you'll see Clothes, Kilt.

17
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,400
So I'll go to Edit Reference Bones, and add the kilt setup.

18
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,460
And right away, this gives me these bones arranged kind of like a skirt.

19
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,020
Now, normally, in Edit Reference Bones, you won't go to Pose Mode, but just for a second, I'm going to go to Pose Mode.

20
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:01,000
So we have this Master Bone, and if we move it around in Pose Mode, you'll see that all of the skirt bones are parented to it.

21
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,100
And also, the Master Skirt Bone is parented to the bottom spine bone.

22
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,880
Autoretic Pro just assumed that I would like to parent the skirt to the waist of the character.

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:20,020
So it does this automatically, but if you wanted to parent the skirt to another spine bone, you can go to Edit Mode, select your Skirt Master,

24
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,520
Shift-Select the spine bone that you want to parent to, and then just press Ctrl-P and Keep Offset.

25
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,840
I'm not going to do this here because I'm happy with my parenting.

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,860
The next step is to align the skirt bones.

27
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm going to place the Skirt Master in the middle of the body.

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,280
Then go to the Armature tab, Viewport Display, and switch the display to Stick.

29
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,900
I find that this makes it much easier to align the skirt bones.

30
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,480
And in this case, having In Front Enabled is a little bit confusing, so I'm going to turn it off.

31
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,620
And now, I can start moving these bones.

32
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,840
So, I want to align the top of each bone with the top of the skirt, and the bottom of each bone to the bottom of the skirt.

33
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:15,820
To do so, I'm going to switch to Face Project, and then just grab one bone end, hold Ctrl, and snap it to the surface of the skirt.

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,880
Then grab the other end, and snap it to the bottom of the skirt.

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,320
And I'll just keep doing that for all bones.

36
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,160
I have X Mirroring enabled, so I only have to do one side.

37
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,100
Once I have the bones aligned, I can go to AutoRig Pro again, and match the rig.

38
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,120
And now you'll see that we have some skirt bones.

39
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,640
So, to see how they work, let's do a quick skinning.

40
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,240
I'll select the body, and skirt, and then shift select the rig, go to Skin.

41
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,900
And with these default options, I'm going to click Bind.

42
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,940
Now, if I move the leg of the character, you'll see that it is just poking through a skirt, and nothing is happening.

43
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,960
I can grab one of these skirt controllers, and manually rotate it, but that is not what we want.

44
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,060
We want automation. So, let's set it up.

45
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,600
Go back to Rig, Edit Reference Bones.

46
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:20,880
And now, if I select the kilt master bone, or any of the individual skirt bones, the limb options button will become active.

47
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,700
And if I click on it, I'll get all of the options that are related to the skirt rig.

48
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,180
And I'm going to explain all of these settings, but first, let's set up the automation, or the collision.

49
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,800
To set it up, you need to specify the leg left and leg right fields.

50
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:45,560
For the standard OuterRig Pro rig, you have to start typing thigh, and for the left leg, choose thigh L.

51
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,480
And then thigh R for the right leg.

52
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,380
Press OK. Match the rig.

53
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,880
And now, if I try to move the leg, you'll see that something is happening.

54
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,260
We still have a lot of overlap between the leg and the skirt.

55
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:11,800
If I select one of the skirt bones, and go to Tool, here we have rig settings, which we can tweak and change the behavior of the rig on the fly.

56
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,820
And because I have a skirt bone selected, I have rig settings related to the skirt.

57
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,760
The first setting is Collide, and it goes from 1 to 0.

58
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,780
0 simply means off. That will be the same as having no automation.

59
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,200
So just keep it to 1.

60
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,740
The next setting is one of the most important ones.

61
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,100
If you increase it, you'll see that the skirt will start covering the leg.

62
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,480
Collide Distance is basically the distance between each bone and the leg that affects it.

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,180
If you increase this too much, you'll see that some bones start being affected, even though the leg is not even moved.

64
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,400
So that is too much. I'm going to undo.

65
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,980
The next setting I'm going to skip for a second, and then Collide Spread.

66
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,940
If you increase it, you'll notice that more and more skirt bones are being affected.

67
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,960
And this setting is also very important when trying to make this setup as automated as possible.

68
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,280
On this one too, if you push it too far, it starts getting weird.

69
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,660
So be careful with it. And just increase it as much as needed.

70
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,160
This setup is not meant to be perfect.

71
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,720
So at some point, at some extreme angle, the leg will poke through the skirt.

72
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,840
In these cases, you can improve this manually.

73
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,160
So my point is, don't try to make this completely automatic.

74
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,980
That may be a waste of time.

75
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,280
The best approach, in my opinion, is to make it as automatic as possible,

76
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,480
but don't think that something is wrong just because you have to make some manual tweaks here and there.

77
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,700
The ideal animation workflow is to just animate your main bones, your legs,

78
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:52,980
and then as a second animation pass, come through and manually fix any intersections between the legs and the cloth that you can find.

79
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,760
And finally, we have this Collide Falloff setting.

80
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,740
Unlike the other settings, I find it a little bit unintuitive,

81
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,420
but it will also increase or decrease the automation effect.

82
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,360
So play with it and see what works.

83
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,320
By the way, you also have this Master Control,

84
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,540
which can be used to move the whole skirt around.

85
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,960
So these are the basics, but we can go a little bit deeper.

86
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,020
If I go to ARP and Edit Reference Bones,

87
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,180
select one of the skirt bones and again, Limb Options.

88
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,220
Let's see what other options we have here.

89
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,020
So first of all, we have Count Per Side.

90
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,700
And it was set to 6.

91
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,360
And if I count the number of skirt bones, you'll find out that there are 12.

92
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,820
So 6 on each side.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,900
So this setting here will set how many skirt bones we have.

94
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,420
We can go as low as 3 or as high as 128, which will be a little bit crazy.

95
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,380
I'm going to set it to 4 for a second and press OK just to see the effect.

96
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,460
And you'll see that now I have 8 skirt bones.

97
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,500
Now, if I move some of them around a little bit and then go back to the Limb Options,

98
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,760
you'll see this Preserve Shape setting.

99
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,880
So if I change the count to 6, let's say, and have Preserve Shape on,

100
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:14,020
you'll see that Autoric Pro tried to respect these changes to the bones that I did when I had 4 bones.

101
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:23,260
Whereas, if I disable this and change the count, it will completely reset the shape of the bones,

102
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,140
which may be what you want when you make changes.

103
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,500
I was happy with the previous setup, so I'll try to undo.

104
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,960
Here I have my 6 bones.

105
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,900
So let's see what other options we have.

106
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,320
There are Master Controllers, so let's enable them.

107
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,580
Press OK.

108
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,720
And match the rig.

109
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,300
And now, aside from the green controls, we have new red controls.

110
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,720
And they control not just one bone, but a couple of adjacent bones.

111
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,100
So these Master Controllers can make your life a little bit easier.

112
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,540
Instead of rotating one bone at a time, you can affect multiple bones and work faster.

113
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,020
Let's go back to Edit Reference Bones.

114
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,020
Limb Options.

115
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,440
And so, here we have Master Frequency.

116
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,780
Actually, it seems like my count is set to 4, so let's set it to 6 again.

117
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,460
And go back to Limb Options.

118
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:30,140
So Master Frequency set to 2 means that for every two individual bones, I'll have one Master Control.

119
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,860
If you want to have less, you can increase this number.

120
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,980
Next, we have Subdivision, and that will give you more control in your final rig.

121
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,480
So let's set Subdivision to 2, and press OK.

122
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,220
And match the rig.

123
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
And you'll see that we have additional skirt bones.

124
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,380
These additional bones do not affect the skirt.

125
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,880
So I have to select the meshes, Shift-select the rig, skin, and just bind again.

126
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,620
And now I have these additional skirt bones, which will give me even more control over the skirt.

127
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,640
And I also have Master Controllers on each row.

128
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,200
OK.

129
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,460
Let's go back to Edit Reference Bones.

130
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,500
Limb Options.

131
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:20,280
So if I have a subdivision of 3, and match the rig, I'll have 3 rows.

132
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,920
And I'll have to skin things again.

133
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,860
But that gives me even more control.

134
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,170
Next, we have the option to subdivide the reference bones.

135
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:47,950
If I keep this unchecked, even though I have 3 subdivisions for each bone, in reference bones mode, I have a single bone for each skirt segment.

136
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,230
And that just makes it much easier to align the bones.

137
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,910
But if you prefer to have more control, you can choose to subdivide the reference bones.

138
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,010
Press OK.

139
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,350
And you'll see that now each skirt segment consists of 3 bones.

140
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:09,470
So, if you have a skirt with a weird shape, you'll be able to align your bones to it exactly as you want.

141
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,760
So, I'm going to set subdivision to 2, with subdivide reference bones.

142
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,260
Just to make it a little bit more manageable.

143
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,100
And then I'll align these bones.

144
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,430
Just like before, using face snapping.

145
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,620
Match the rig.

146
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,260
Then I'm going to reskin just for good measure.

147
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,900
Right.

148
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,400
Let's take a look at the remaining settings.

149
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,440
The master controller's row setting.

150
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,400
If we enable it, then press OK.

151
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
And match the rig.

152
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,940
Will give us additional master controllers.

153
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,180
These big circular controllers control an entire row of the skirt.

154
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,760
And that's all there is to it.

155
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,060
It can be very useful.

156
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,180
We also have this option for interactive collision distance.

157
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,400
Which is on by default.

158
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
And I always keep it on.

159
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,500
Supposedly, if you turn it off, it will take away from the tweakability of the rig.

160
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,940
But it would give you better performance.

161
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,060
But the performance hit is not that big.

162
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,100
And so, generally, I would keep this option on.

163
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,380
And finally, we have collide on Z.

164
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,900
This is an additional option that will give you additional precision in the interaction between legs and skirt.

165
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,160
According to the manual, this option also has a little bit of a performance cost.

166
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,220
In exchange, it creates better interaction, better automation.

167
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,960
And again, the performance cost is not something that you should worry about in general.

168
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,680
But if your PC is very slow, or if your scene is very heavy, then keep it off.

169
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,920
And finally, we have shapes.

170
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,640
With the scale slider, you can change the scale of these skirt controls.

171
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,480
And these options here will determine where the controls will appear.

172
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,120
Currently, the option is set to tail, which means that controls will appear at the end of the bones.

173
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,680
But you can switch it to head, which means at the beginning of the bone.

174
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,760
Or middle, which means in the middle of the bone.

175
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,580
Let's set it to middle.

176
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,460
So it should appear here, and here, and here, and so on.

177
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,080
Match to rig.

178
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,480
And that is exactly where the controls appear.

179
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,780
And that's all about the new skirt rig in AutoRig Pro.

180
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,080
Enjoy and happy rigging.
