00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,920
Hey, welcome to the first actual tutorial in this series about using AutoRig Pro.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,080
If you don't yet have AutoRig Pro, you may want to check out the first two videos.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:17,240
They are meant to help you decide if AutoRig Pro is right for you, if you should buy it.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,480
If you're here, then I assume that you already have the add-on, or maybe you want to get

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,060
a feel for how it works.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,760
In this video we'll be rigging humans.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,900
This is one of the most common rigging tasks, and AutoRig Pro has amazing tools and automations,

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,940
but I want to emphasize that AutoRig Pro can do much more than that.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,700
You could rig animals with it, like dogs, horses, even birds, and you can even rig fantasy creatures

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,940
that don't really exist in the real world.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,060
I think most tutorials stop at the human rig, but in this series I want to try to cover all

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,160
sorts of scenarios that AutoRig Pro can handle.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,440
So, if you want to see this, make sure to subscribe with notifications and so on.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,280
Also feel free to let me know what kind of content you would like to see in the comments, and

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,780
I may include it in the course.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,380
Okay, so next you need AutoRig Pro.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,680
If you haven't bought it already, you can go to the add-ons page on the Blender Market

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,180
and purchase it.

19
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,840
I'm going to give you a link.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,840
It's going to be an affiliate link, which means that I'll make a little profit if you buy

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,280
through it.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,800
Once you've bought the add-on, you'll be able to view your order, and in here you'll

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,600
be able to download AutoRig Pro.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,840
And below it, you'll see a README on how to install the add-ons.

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,980
So download these files, and you can go ahead and read the text file, or you can keep watching

26
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,340
the video.

27
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,180
I'm going to show you how to install the add-on.

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,020
So usually, when you download an add-on as a zip file, you can just go to Edit, Preferences,

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,120
Add-ons, click Install, and go ahead and install the zip file that you downloaded.

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,140
In the case of AutoRig Pro, it is a little bit different.

31
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,860
Here I'm going to open up the zip file.

32
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,140
Here is the contents, and you'll see that it contains a .py file, and two more zip files,

33
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,040
and a 2.79 folder.

34
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,300
You have to unzip these files somewhere on your hard drive.

35
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,020
So personally, I have a special folder where I place the newest version of AutoRig Pro.

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:22,140
So here I'm going to delete the previous version that I had, and just select all of these files

37
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,060
and place them in this folder.

38
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,960
If you're using the ancient Blender 2.79, then go into this folder, and you can use these

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,600
special files for the older Blender version.

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,600
I've never done that, and I'm not going to cover this.

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:45,180
Personally I'll be using the newest version of Blender, Blender 3.2, and the newest version

42
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,980
of AutoRig Pro.

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,080
So the actual AutoRig Pro add-on is this one, AutoRig Pro Master.zip.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,900
The Proxy Picker is an additional tool that I'll cover in a separate video, and RigTools.zip

45
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,740
is a mini add-on that you can send to someone else when you're sharing your AutoRig Pro rig

46
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,380
with them.

47
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,140
To make full use of the rig, they need this mini add-on, and it's very important that

48
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,160
you do not install both add-ons.

49
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,100
So in this case, we are only going to install AutoRig Pro Master, okay?

50
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:26,200
I'll go back to Blender, Edit, Preferences, Add-ons, click on Install, and I'll go to my

51
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,700
folder where I keep AutoRig Pro, and highlight AutoRig Pro Master and install it.

52
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,300
And then I'll put a check mark next to the add-on's name.

53
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,700
There are some add-ons options that I'm going to cover in another video.

54
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,000
In this video, I just want to keep it simple and focus on some of the most useful and commonly

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,760
used features.

56
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,760
So in this video, I'm going to show you two examples of rigging a humanoid character.

57
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,080
One will be very simple, and the other one will be more complex.

58
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,060
It is only because AutoRig Pro has really cool features that I can use such a complex character

59
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,820
in a beginner's tutorial.

60
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,740
And if you want to follow along with me with the exact models that I'm using, I'm going

61
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,980
to share these models for free on Gumroad.

62
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,920
And most likely, you'll be able to pay a little extra and get some bonuses, but you'll be able

63
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,300
to get the main files for free.

64
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,620
I'll share a link to the Gumroad page in the video notes.

65
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:29,060
Okay, so I'll open my first file, and it should be called something like ARP Rigging Simple.

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,940
And when you open it, you should see this file here.

67
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,900
You may recognize this guy from my Rigify series.

68
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,520
And up here, you'll see a little info about the license.

69
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,440
Basically, this is my file.

70
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,140
I'm releasing it as Creative Commons, so you can use it for whatever you like.

71
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,060
Just try to credit CGDive, and thank you if you do.

72
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,940
And then I'm going to close this and focus on my character.

73
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,740
So I just installed AutoRig Pro.

74
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,900
So if I open the end panel here, I'll have the ARP ARP tab.

75
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,760
And here is the main AutoRig Pro interface.

76
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,120
At the top, you'll have the AutoRig Pro rigging features.

77
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,420
Below it is the smart features, which we'll actually be using in a second.

78
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,900
The smart features allow you to rig a humanoid character really simply.

79
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,840
Remap is actually retargeting.

80
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,120
And I already covered retargeting.

81
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,720
If you want to know how to use this feature in AutoRig Pro, I already have a really in-depth

82
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,740
video about that.

83
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,040
And I'll share a link.

84
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,520
And finally, we have export, which basically helps you export AutoRig Pro rigs to game

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,480
engines or other applications.

86
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,880
But mainly game engines, and there are special presets for Unity and Unreal.

87
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,580
Alright, that was the overview.

88
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,740
Now we're going to focus on the smart features.

89
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,480
So I'm going to select my little character here, click the only button that I see here

90
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,560
under smart, get selected objects.

91
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,340
You have the choice between full body and facial only.

92
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,880
We're going to be doing the body now, so full body and press OK.

93
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,460
When we press OK, AutoRig Pro automatically puts us in front view, and it gives us these buttons.

94
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,640
So the main button that we are interested in is this Add button.

95
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,440
So first we want to add the neck.

96
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,520
When I press the button, this circle will appear, and I can place it somewhere at the base of the neck.

97
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:33,720
There isn't a very precise guide as to where to place these points, but you don't have to be super precise.

98
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,140
And you can also fine-tune the placement of the actual bones later.

99
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,860
You'll see that in a minute.

100
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,820
So next I want to place a chin.

101
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,780
So I'm going to place it around here, and I can also zoom in.

102
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,980
Once I've clicked to confirm, I can always press G again and keep moving the marker.

103
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,420
Next, I'm going to zoom out and add the shoulders.

104
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,340
So when placing the shoulders, don't really place them on the top of the shoulder.

105
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,780
Place it a little bit inside the volume of the shoulder.

106
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,820
Something like this.

107
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,960
And if your character is symmetrical like mine, you can keep the mirror option on,

108
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,660
and you can simply work on one marker and the other one will be set up automatically.

109
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:20,640
If your character is not symmetrical, then you can turn off mirror and move each one individually.

110
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,620
But in my case, I want to use the mirror option to save some time.

111
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,000
So next we want to add the wrist, like this.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,320
Next, spine root.

113
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,680
So again, this is not entirely clear, but place it somewhere in the crotch area,

114
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,040
maybe a little bit higher, something like this, where the base of the spine would be.

115
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,600
And next we want to add the ankles.

116
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,500
So somewhere here.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,700
And here is another important tip.

118
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,580
You only need to place these markers from the front view.

119
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,660
Technically, you can go to the side view.

120
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,840
In this case, they are already kind of in a good position,

121
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,980
but you can possibly try to move them around, but you don't need to.

122
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,720
You just need to place them from the front view and then Autoric Pro knows what to do.

123
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,820
One exception may be the ankle.

124
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,300
I just find it a little bit easier to find the right spot from the side view.

125
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,480
So something like this.

126
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,760
These are all of the markers that we need.

127
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,360
Next, Autoric Pro will try to automatically place all of the bones, including fingers.

128
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,100
And it will try to detect the fingers automatically.

129
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,740
We just need to let it know how many fingers there are.

130
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,280
You can have up to five, like in a realistic human.

131
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,240
But in this case, my character is simplified and it has basically a glove hand.

132
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,640
So basically I have two fingers.

133
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,460
This big lump and then the thumb.

134
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,460
So I'm going to set my number of fingers to two.

135
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,180
Below it are the settings for the automatic finger detection.

136
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,440
I usually just use the default settings and it tends to work well.

137
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,740
And if it doesn't, then we can tweak the fingers manually.

138
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,300
I'm going to show you this as well.

139
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,220
Most of the settings we're going to leave to default.

140
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,980
So this skeleton setting is mainly if you're going to be using Unreal.

141
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,200
For now, we're going to leave it to default.

142
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,080
Spine count will define how many spine bones there will be.

143
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,800
My character is kind of simple, so three is fine.

144
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,460
These next options are kind of advanced.

145
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,280
We can talk about them in another video.

146
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,260
Neck count will define how many neck bones there will be.

147
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,360
This character again is kind of simple.

148
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,420
One is fine.

149
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,540
Twist count is the number of twist bones.

150
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,340
So in the legs and arms, each part of the limb.

151
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,720
So for example, the upper arm and the lower arm can have twist bones.

152
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,000
And they should have twist bones because that helps with the deformation.

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,780
Of the character.

154
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,880
So the default is twist count of one.

155
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,120
Which means that one additional bone will be placed here at the shoulder.

156
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,880
And one at the wrist.

157
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,360
And that will help improve the deformations.

158
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,160
And it is similar with the leg.

159
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,120
So I'm going to keep this to default.

160
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,840
Then we have facial setup.

161
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,140
And my character doesn't have any face features.

162
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,640
So I'm going to skip this.

163
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,980
And I can go ahead and press go.

164
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,860
Which will create some bones for me.

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,960
So it is important to understand that this is not the final rig.

166
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,220
These are the so-called reference bones.

167
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,340
Or if you have Rigify experience, you can call it MetaRig.

168
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,760
So in most cases, ARP will do a good job at placing the bones at the right places.

169
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,420
Usually, the elbow may need a little bit of tweaking.

170
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,300
For the elbow, it is important, just like in Rigify, that the arm is not too straight.

171
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,580
You want to give a little bit of an angle to these two bones.

172
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,720
Autoreg Pro will do this automatically.

173
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,620
But if you're tweaking this position, then keep that in mind.

174
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,760
And here we can see the placement of the fingers.

175
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,380
It is not bad, but we can tweak it a little bit.

176
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,200
If I look from the front view, this joint here seems a little bit misplaced.

177
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,580
I'm just going to move it deeper inside the hand.

178
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,580
So something like this.

179
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,860
And then this joint can be a little bit deeper into the thump.

180
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,240
Okay, this looks good.

181
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,800
The knee can be a little bit lower.

182
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,740
And these bones, these little bones at the foot, will determine the behavior of the foot.

183
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,780
And we kind of need to place them at the edges of the foot.

184
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,200
Something like this.

185
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,560
When working with the reference bones, you can go to the Autoreg Pro tab.

186
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,820
And in here, you have a bunch of useful features, which I'm going to cover in an advanced video.

187
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,740
For now, I just want to show you how easy it is to achieve good results with just the default settings.

188
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:04,300
But basically, if you select any of these bones, you have limp options for each of the parts of the rig.

189
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,880
You can duplicate them and delete them and so on to create advanced rigs.

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,480
But for now, I just want to go ahead and click match to rig.

191
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,860
So this is the magic button that will create an advanced rig for you.

192
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,140
So let's click it.

193
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,160
And you'll see these pretty shapes that Autoreg Pro created for us.

194
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,880
And that's it. The rig is actually working.

195
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,840
We can go to pause mode now and give it a try.

196
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,300
So you'll see that something is happening, but the character itself is not moving.

197
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:41,460
To make sure that our rig moves the character, there is a process called binding or skinning or weighting.

198
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,800
So I'll go to object mode and click on the skin tab under Autoreg Pro.

199
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,420
I'm going to select the mesh and then shift select the character.

200
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,580
And Autoreg Pro has a bunch of advanced binding options.

201
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,640
And I'm actually going to cover some of them in the next example in the advanced character.

202
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,180
But for this simple character, you can just press the bind button.

203
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,560
And a second later, you can go to your rig, go to pause mode.

204
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,440
By the way, I'm using a pie menu. You can just go in here and choose pause mode.

205
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:22,400
And now if you move the hand, for example, the whole arm will be moving in IK mode.

206
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,920
I'm going to try to give you an overview of the rig controls.

207
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,280
For now, let's not go too deep into this.

208
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,480
But you can see that the character is moving with the rig and you can see how easy it was.

209
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,500
We just placed a couple of markers, pressed a couple of buttons and now we have this.

210
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,480
We have a moving character. It's pretty cool.

211
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,540
So I hope this shows you that rigging, especially when using an Autorigger, doesn't need to be scary.

212
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,800
And when you're ready, let's move on to the advanced example.

213
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,580
I'm going to open my complex human example.

214
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,700
Here it is.

215
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,900
And again, here you can read the license.

216
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,860
In this case, I downloaded this model from Sketchfab.

217
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,080
The license was Creative Commons Attribution, which means that I have to give credit to the original creator.

218
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,020
Thank you for this great model.

219
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,780
And I did some edits myself.

220
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:30,320
Basically, when you import Sketchfab models into Blender, they can have some problems and I just cleaned up the model and the materials.

221
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,780
So again, feel free to use this model for any purpose, as long as you credit the creators.

222
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,740
So let's take a quick look at this model.

223
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,100
It actually consists of several separate meshes.

224
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,200
So the main one is this body mesh, which I can hide.

225
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,920
And then there is a hair mesh.

226
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,820
Both eyes are a separate object.

227
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,980
There are eyelashes, upper teeth, lower teeth and a tongue.

228
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,320
So let's undo.

229
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
And Alt H to unhide everything.

230
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,980
So if you have a similar model, but everything is joined into a single object, I can do something like this.

231
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,680
Just select everything, Ctrl J and join.

232
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:22,420
And then I could go to edit mode and press L to select the different parts that I want to separate into a separate object.

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,140
I can also box select like this and then press Ctrl L and that will complete the selection.

234
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,100
And now, let's see.

235
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,220
Another technique is to enable X-Ray.

236
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,540
Okay.

237
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,740
And now everything that I wanted is selected.

238
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,080
I'm going to press P and split it into a new model.

239
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,720
And I can keep doing this, just selecting the meshes and separating them.

240
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,200
So I'm going to just undo.

241
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,440
And get my separate meshes.

242
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:08,780
And when rigging this kind of complex character with AutoRig Pro, you may want to hide meshes that will get in the way.

243
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,720
Especially when doing the facial setup.

244
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,540
This character has facial features.

245
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,460
So we are going to rig the face as well.

246
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,420
So I want to hide the hair and also the eyelashes.

247
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,620
I'll explain why in a second.

248
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,400
Okay, so with that, I can just box select over the whole character.

249
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
This will also select the teeth.

250
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,480
That is not that important because they are inside.

251
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,960
So they won't get in the way.

252
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,880
So then I can go to ARP, Smart.

253
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,340
And I have to make one of the objects active.

254
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,280
So just shift and click on it.

255
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,640
Go to Smart and get selected objects.

256
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,040
Choose full body and press OK.

257
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,820
So now the process is the same as in the previous part.

258
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,660
Add neck.

259
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,540
Add chin.

260
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,380
Add shoulders.

261
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,920
Kind of inside the shoulder volume.

262
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,020
Add wrists.

263
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,960
Add spine root.

264
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,160
Add ankles.

265
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Again, I'm going to look from the side view just for the ankles.

266
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,780
And place them around here.

267
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,160
Now this is a realistic character and it has five fingers.

268
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,360
So number of fingers, five.

269
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,100
And the detection settings, I'll just leave to default.

270
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,720
Spine count and the other settings, I'll leave to default.

271
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,400
And then I want to do the facial setup.

272
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,100
Just press on the button and go to front view.

273
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,300
And Autoreg Pro gives us these lines that we want to align to our character.

274
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,800
So first there is the chin.

275
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:52,400
And just like with the body markers, there is no precise guide as to where to place them.

276
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,300
But a lot of them actually make sense.

277
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,000
So for example, this is the chin line.

278
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:06,020
So I want to place the lower dot at the bottom of the chin and the upper one at the end of the chin.

279
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,900
Something like this.

280
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,380
Then the mouth.

281
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,980
I may want to show the textures here.

282
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,600
And then I can press L to select the whole mouth marker.

283
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,280
And I can move it with G.

284
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,400
I can also scale it.

285
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,980
And then I'm going to scale it down a little bit.

286
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,700
And then scale and press Z to scale it on the Z axis.

287
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,920
And then place these corners at the corners of the mouth.

288
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,220
So you can place these dots on the outline of the mouth.

289
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,940
But there is an official video from the creator of Autoreg Pro.

290
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,280
And he places these markers a little bit inside the volume of the mouth.

291
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,940
The nose.

292
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,260
This is the tip of the nose.

293
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,760
And this is basically the top of the nose.

294
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,840
When aligning the eyes, I may actually want to go to object mode here.

295
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,180
Object mode.

296
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,300
And select the eyelashes.

297
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,440
When you go into the face setup, Autoreg Pro unhides all of the meshes for some reason.

298
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,400
So I'm going to hide these again.

299
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,980
Select the markers again.

300
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,000
Go to edit mode.

301
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
And then again go to front view.

302
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,260
With L, I'm going to select this whole marker for the eye.

303
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,120
Press S and Z to squash it.

304
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,380
Move it over the eye.

305
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,660
I can rotate it and scale it.

306
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,120
And that will give me almost perfect alignment in this case.

307
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,760
But I can then grab each of the individual dots and place them where they should be.

308
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,320
So this is the inner corner of the eye.

309
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,740
And this is the outer corner.

310
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,460
And the rest of the dots are just aligned at the outline of the eye.

311
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,680
Then we have the browse.

312
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,740
And here the texture tells me exactly where to place the markers.

313
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,000
If I was in a solid mode, I wouldn't be quite sure where to place them.

314
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,500
Another technique is to enable wireframe.

315
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,220
And that may enable you to see where the placement should go.

316
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,540
But yeah.

317
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,480
But in this case, the texture will show us the exact placement.

318
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,880
And now we come to this line here.

319
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,580
Which to me is the most mysterious and unclear of all.

320
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,020
But again, if we look at the image from the official video.

321
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,540
It is placed something like this.

322
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,600
Along the cheeks of the character.

323
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,460
And finally we have the ears.

324
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,820
So just align this dot with the bottom of the ear.

325
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,420
And this one with the top of the ear.

326
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,500
And make sure that all dots are overlapping with the mesh.

327
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,380
If you have a dot like this, you will get an error when you press go.

328
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,540
I'm going to show you in a second.

329
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,580
And here we have the eyeball setup.

330
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,700
So here again, I'm going to go to object mode.

331
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,120
Select my eye mesh.

332
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,180
And you'll see that both eyes are joined into a single object.

333
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,980
So in this case, I want to select one eye object.

334
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,560
One.

335
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,520
And it will be my eyes object.

336
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,620
If, if I go to edit mode.

337
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,280
And I select one of the eyes.

338
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,360
And separate it into a separate mesh.

339
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,360
Then I have to select two eyes.

340
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,740
And select the right eyeball in this field here.

341
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,920
But I'm going to undo.

342
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,300
Okay.

343
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,040
My eyes are again joined into a single object.

344
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,260
Now I'm going to select one eyeball.

345
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,160
And my eyes object.

346
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,840
If this field is empty.

347
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,820
And you press go.

348
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,580
You'll get an error.

349
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,600
So make sure that you enter the eyes in here.

350
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,140
And also here is the other error that you can get.

351
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,280
If I just move this marker outside of the mesh.

352
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:45,980
And press go.

353
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,100
I'll get another error.

354
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,220
So I'll undo.

355
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,400
Everything is overlapping.

356
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,920
Eyes are set up.

357
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,140
And then I can press go.

358
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,130
And here just like in the previous example.

359
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,390
Autoreg Pro created the bones for us.

360
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,170
In this case.

361
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,270
It also created reference bones.

362
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,430
For the eyes.

363
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:07,930
Mouth.

364
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,510
So for the whole face.

365
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,790
So usually the first thing that you should check.

366
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,230
Is the fingers.

367
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,330
And in this case.

368
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,550
Autoreg Pro did an almost perfect job.

369
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,230
At detecting the fingers.

370
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,170
If some of the fingers are misaligned.

371
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:23,850
Like this.

372
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,590
In my opinion.

373
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,170
The best way to align them.

374
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,030
Is to switch to volume snapping.

375
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,770
Keep snapping off.

376
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,770
And then move the joint.

377
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:33,810
And hold control.

378
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,390
And it will snap into the volume of the finger.

379
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,110
Something important about the fingers.

380
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:41,930
Is that.

381
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,250
There is a little bit of a curvature to them.

382
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,510
If the curvature is opposite.

383
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,390
Like this.

384
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,250
Then the rotation of the finger.

385
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,530
Will also be wrong.

386
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:53,910
So.

387
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,010
Give them the correct curvature.

388
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,900
Other than that.

389
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,540
It looks good.

390
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,860
Maybe the shoulder can be a little bit deeper.

391
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,640
Into the mesh.

392
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,420
And the elbow.

393
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,960
This mesh.

394
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,000
Doesn't really have a well defined elbow.

395
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,460
But somewhere around here.

396
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:12,920
Is fine.

397
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,280
I guess.

398
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,520
It can be a little bit hard to tell.

399
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,560
If the reference bones.

400
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,120
For the face.

401
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:21,760
Are perfect.

402
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,860
But usually.

403
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,460
Autoreg Pro does a good job.

404
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,300
And here is why.

405
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,540
We hit the eyelashes.

406
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,360
And the hair.

407
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,340
You'll see that.

408
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:31,960
The hair.

409
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,740
Is overlapping.

410
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,480
With the.

411
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,500
Brows.

412
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,340
So.

413
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,320
If we had the hair.

414
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,020
Selected.

415
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:37,820
These.

416
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,640
Brow bones.

417
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,580
Would be.

418
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,940
On top of the hair.

419
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,440
Which is.

420
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,360
Not what we want.

421
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,820
And same with the eyes.

422
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,460
If the eyelashes.

423
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:46,920
Were.

424
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:47,500
There.

425
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,980
Then the eye bones.

426
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,060
Would be generated.

427
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,380
On top of the eyelashes.

428
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,140
Rather than.

429
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
On the actual eyelids.

430
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,080
So.

431
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,660
We helped.

432
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,400
Autoreg Pro.

433
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,320
Align everything.

434
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:57,920
Correctly.

435
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,940
And that way.

436
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,940
We won't have to do.

437
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,580
Any manual.

438
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,060
Work.

439
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,860
Or at least.

440
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,380
Not too much.

441
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,120
So.

442
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,700
Check your rig.

443
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,080
Again.

444
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,880
You may need.

445
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,540
To align.

446
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,460
These little bones.

447
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:09,740
Again.

448
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,360
At the edges.

449
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:11,920
Of the foot.

450
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,760
And this one.

451
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,280
In the middle.

452
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,520
So.

453
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:23,940
From here.

454
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,500
I can go.

455
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,580
To the Autoreg Pro.

456
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:25,960
Tab.

457
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,140
And again.

458
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:27,780
In here.

459
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,600
I can select.

460
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,400
Any of the.

461
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,260
Rig parts.

462
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:30,740
And.

463
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,540
Check the limb.

464
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,000
Options.

465
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,720
Again.

466
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,400
This is something.

467
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:33,940
That we'll.

468
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,820
Talk about.

469
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,700
In another video.

470
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,720
For now.

471
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,360
Let's just use.

472
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,080
The default settings.

473
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,840
And see.

474
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,440
If we can get.

475
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,320
Good results.

476
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,260
So.

477
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Click the magic button.

478
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,620
Match the rig.

479
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,280
And get the pretty shapes.

480
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,840
Nice.

481
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:49,940
Next.

482
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,300
Again.

483
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,020
We want to skin.

484
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,480
The character.

485
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,380
And to do so.

486
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,020
I'm going to go.

487
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,700
To object mode.

488
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,400
Select all meshes.

489
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,420
And then.

490
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,120
Shift select.

491
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:58,580
The rig.

492
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:58,840
So.

493
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,320
Make sure.

494
00:24:59,380 --> 00:24:59,980
That the rig.

495
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,420
Is.

496
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,440
The active object.

497
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,140
Then go.

498
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,560
To skin.

499
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,520
If.

500
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,720
If a mesh.

501
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,640
Is the active object.

502
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,280
Then.

503
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,020
We won't be able.

504
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,660
To click bind.

505
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,100
So.

506
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,640
I'll make.

507
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,460
The rig.

508
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:10,840
Active.

509
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:11,720
So.

510
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,980
Next.

511
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,020
We already.

512
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,900
Did this.

513
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,360
In the.

514
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,300
Simple example.

515
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,260
But the more.

516
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,060
The character.

517
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:23,480
Gets.

518
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,140
The more.

519
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:24,800
Difficult.

520
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,240
It is.

521
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:25,940
To weight it.

522
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,660
Nicely.

523
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,620
Binding.

524
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,100
Is.

525
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,900
As important.

526
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,140
In rigging.

527
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:30,920
As.

528
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,700
The creation.

529
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,280
Of this.

530
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:32,680
Amateur.

531
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,440
And that's.

532
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:33,580
Why.

533
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,400
It's really nice.

534
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,180
That auto rig.

535
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,500
Pro.

536
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,740
To make.

537
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,380
The binding.

538
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:38,780
Process.

539
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,340
A little bit.

540
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:39,720
Easier.

541
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,620
So.

542
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,080
Let's look.

543
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,720
At the settings.

544
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,400
First.

545
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,800
We have.

546
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,440
The engine.

547
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,480
And by default.

548
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,100
It is set.

549
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,160
To heat maps.

550
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:46,780
So.

551
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,180
If you have.

552
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,560
A little bit.

553
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,260
Of experience.

554
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:48,540
With.

555
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:48,960
Rigging.

556
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,380
In blender.

557
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,400
You may know.

558
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,000
Blender's.

559
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,700
Automatic weights.

560
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:52,760
If I have.

561
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,160
A mesh.

562
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,520
And.

563
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,380
A rig.

564
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:54,840
Selected.

565
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,220
And press.

566
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,460
Control.

567
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:55,720
P.

568
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,980
I can choose.

569
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,300
With.

570
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:57,960
Automatic weights.

571
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,100
And that will.

572
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,600
Automatically.

573
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,360
Assign weights.

574
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,080
To the character.

575
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,420
When it works.

576
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:02,940
It is.

577
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,640
Really great.

578
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,380
The problem.

579
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,820
Is that.

580
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,340
Sometimes.

581
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:05,900
It fails.

582
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,520
So.

583
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:06,780
Here.

584
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,500
Autoreg Pro.

585
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,060
Is using.

586
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,580
The exact.

587
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:08,900
Same.

588
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,500
Feature.

589
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:09,980
That we have.

590
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,440
In blender.

591
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,180
Automatic weights.

592
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:11,820
But.

593
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,260
It can do.

594
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,500
Some.

595
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,640
Operations.

596
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,900
To help.

597
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,820
Avoid errors.

598
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,680
For example.

599
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:17,780
By default.

600
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,400
It splits.

601
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:18,940
The meshes.

602
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:19,560
So.

603
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,280
Very often.

604
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:20,940
The error.

605
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,460
That happens.

606
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,100
With.

607
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:22,860
Automatic weights.

608
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:23,380
Is.

609
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:23,660
Because.

610
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,160
They are.

611
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,060
Overlapping.

612
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:25,700
Meshes.

613
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:36,940
Which is.

614
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:37,240
Very.

615
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:37,900
Dense.

616
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:38,700
With.

617
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,220
Polygons.

618
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,020
You can.

619
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,180
Use.

620
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:40,640
This option.

621
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,540
In our.

622
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,200
It won't.

623
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,320
Be.

624
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:42,640
Needed.

625
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,400
There are.

626
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:43,620
Some.

627
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,480
Advanced settings.

628
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:44,780
That.

629
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,240
I won't.

630
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:45,440
Touch.

631
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:45,740
For now.

632
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,400
We may.

633
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:46,740
Address.

634
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:46,900
Them.

635
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,300
In another.

636
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:47,540
Video.

637
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,240
Then.

638
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:48,560
There is.

639
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,120
Specials.

640
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:49,760
And.

641
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,080
Here.

642
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,480
Again.

643
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:50,840
You can.

644
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,100
Set.

645
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,320
Your.

646
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:51,800
Eyeball.

647
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,100
Object.

648
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,460
And.

649
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:52,620
That.

650
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,420
Automate.

651
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,400
It.

652
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,640
You.

653
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,220
Can.

654
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,660
To.

655
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,140
To.

656
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,180
To.

657
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,480
To.

658
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:57,500
To.

659
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,680
To.

660
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,080
To.

661
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,280
automate the process and then we have even more settings to fine-tune the

662
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,280
binding you can only use the selected bones you know you can go to pose mode

663
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,500
and in here at the last layer is actually where the deforming bones are and if

664
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,240
you just select some of these bones then you can use selected bones only and

665
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,720
that will limit the effect of the binding only to the selected bones I'm

666
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,000
not going to do that right now also you can go to edit mode for the mesh and

667
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,740
just select some vertices and if you use selected vertices only again that will

668
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,840
limit the effect of the binding only to the selected vertices I think we'll have

669
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,560
an opportunity to use this later in this video preserve volume will change

670
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,880
something in the armature modifier I'm not a big fan of this option but I'll leave

671
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,720
it on and I'll show you what it does later in the video scalefix if the

672
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:02,020
binding fails you can try checking this option and binding again this may fix the

673
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,740
problem again it's a little trick that Autoreg Pro does under the hood and so

674
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,180
for now I'm going to keep this default options with the default heat maps engine

675
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:23,560
make the armature active and try to bind so after a couple of seconds the

676
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:29,080
process is finished and if I go to pause mode I can try to move some of the rig

677
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,600
parts and let's see what happens so here you can see that the arm is moving but

678
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,360
here there is a little part that is disconnecting this is a common problem

679
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:47,040
with heat maps but overall it is not too bad it is working and let's check the leg

680
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:53,520
as well so it's also working but here I can see that the foot is stretching for

681
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,400
some reason the shoe actually this is not a very common problem but for some

682
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:14,380
reason we are getting it here the body looks okay the head can also move well it

683
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,940
seems to be affecting part of the jacket which I don't want but we can fix this

684
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:26,700
later this is the jaw widget if I press G to move it it will open the mouth and it

685
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,220
actually works quite well but you can see that the teeth that are inside are

686
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,200
being deformed so this is a very common problem with Autoreg Pro

687
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:43,400
I'm going to show you how to fix it a bit later in the video this is the eyes

688
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,260
widget if I disable overlays and move it around you'll see that the eyes are moving

689
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:57,160
and we even have a little bit of eyelid deformation going on so not too bad so I

690
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:03,100
can select all bones and press Alt-R Alt-G Alt-S and that will just reset the

691
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,660
pose of the character so let's try to switch the binding engine and bind again

692
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,460
and see if we get better results so I'm going to switch to the voxelized engine

693
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:18,420
and again select all meshes and have the rig as active so the voxelized engine is a

694
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:24,620
native feature of Autoreg Pro and it has type 1 and type 2 I usually just use type 1

695
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:30,300
there is a voxel resolution if you increase it you may get better results but the

696
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,900
process may take longer so again with the default settings let's just press bind and

697
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:45,530
see what happens so again after 20 to 30 seconds the process is finished and I can

698
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:51,930
go to pose mode and try to move the arm and here you'll notice right away that

699
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,950
this little piece that was disconnecting before is no longer disconnecting and

700
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:06,630
overall this engine will give you better results with overlapping geometry so again

701
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:11,190
let's try to move the leg and see what happens and the shoe is actually fine now

702
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:17,810
if I rotate the leg around there is just a little bit of clipping between the skin

703
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:23,330
and cloth here we can fix it manually or you can try to play around with the

704
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:32,190
voxelized settings the head will also move fine you'll see that the jacket is no

705
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,810
longer affected but there is a little bit of a problem with the skin here down here

706
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,010
again this is not too much of a problem

707
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:46,550
but now we come to the disadvantages of voxelized skinning if I try to open the

708
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:51,370
mouth you'll see that it doesn't open at all basically voxel skinning is great at

709
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:55,270
overlapping geometry but when there is polygons that are just close to each

710
00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:02,190
other then they'll get fused together like this and also the eyes actually they

711
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:09,330
they're kind of okay but overall heat maps gave us better results for the face and

712
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:15,050
voxelized gave us better results for the body and there is one more option voxel

713
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:19,810
heat diffuse skinning add-on so if you click on it you may see this message saying

714
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:24,410
that the add-on is not installed I actually have this add-on and I made a

715
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:30,190
video about it so if I go to edit preferences add-ons and look for voxel heat

716
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:35,010
diffused skinning and just enable the add-on as soon as it is enabled the

717
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:41,090
warning message will disappear and AutoRig Pro will let me use this add-on

718
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:49,710
but instead of going to the official tab of the add-on I can use it from here so

719
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:57,970
just for fun let's try to bind with this add-on and it's finished now if we try to

720
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:06,170
pose the character you may find a slight differences the overlapping of the sleeves

721
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:14,190
is a little bit better and in the foot if I rotate it around you'll see that skin

722
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:26,320
and cloth are not clipping at all and here if I rotate the head you'll see that the

723
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,920
problem with the skin that we had is gone there is a little bit of problem with the

724
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,660
cloth now so there is no perfect solution but you see that this add-on has some

725
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,920
advantages so if you're okay with spending some additional money you can

726
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,680
also buy this add-on it's really great I use it a lot and again I have a

727
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:51,200
dedicated video about the add-on itself but the native voxelized engine works

728
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,240
great as well so you can use that so I'm going to bind with voxelized again

729
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:08,200
actually let's try type 2 just so we don't rely on any paid add-ons okay so

730
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:17,340
it's done let's see the results really quickly hmm actually the actually the

731
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:25,430
clipping here is fixed that is nice oh and the clipping in this area is fixed as

732
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:30,270
well so it's definitely worth playing around with these binding settings but

733
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:37,210
of course with a voxelized engine you'll always get this problem in the face so if

734
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,970
I just select the face go to edit mode and press alt a to deselect everything and

735
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:50,830
press L while hovering over the face that will select all face vertices then I can go

736
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:56,370
to object mode and shift select the armature let's go to pause mode and really

737
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:00,090
quickly select everything alt R alt G alt S

738
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:07,590
and next in object mode I'm going to switch back to heat maps and choose

739
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:20,340
selected vertices only and then bind so now my face is weighted with heat maps so the

740
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:28,520
mouth will open well but for everything else the voxelized waiting will be kept so

741
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,820
I'm really loving this workflow and if this wasn't a tutorial I would just go

742
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:37,060
through these settings really quickly and it would take less than a minute okay

743
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:44,260
now the character is rigged and weighted so it can move with the rig but there

744
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:53,120
are a couple of problem areas so I'm going to move the rig around and try to notice any problems

745
00:35:53,120 --> 00:36:04,950
and then we'll try to fix them actually this clipping problem is there I'm not sure why it seemed to be

746
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:17,190
gone before but for the most part the problems will be in the face you'll see that the teeth are

747
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:24,050
stretching really badly so I'll definitely fix this this here is supposed to close the eye but

748
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:36,640
the weights are really not good so I'll work on it a little bit and maybe we'll try to address this

749
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:47,040
problem here so it's mostly weight painting problems and by the way let me quickly address

750
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,840
this preserve volume option so we always had this setting checked while binding the mesh what this does

751
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:02,740
is yeah I'll just raise the oops I'll just raise the leg a little bit now go to object mode select

752
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:08,760
the mesh go to the modifier tab and here is the armature modifier which connects the mesh to the bones

753
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:16,700
and in here you'll see this preserve volume option by default blender doesn't use it but I guess the

754
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:23,500
developer of Autoreg Pro likes it so this Autoreg Pro setting here automatically enables this

755
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:30,160
setting in the armature modifier I don't like this setting because it tends to bulge out some areas

756
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,520
of the rig and also it doesn't transfer to game engines so it may make your character's deformation

757
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:43,260
better in blender but this will be lost if you export out of blender if you only plan to animate

758
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,980
inside blender then you can have it on or off whatever looks better to you I'm going to turn it off but if

759
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:58,680
you plan to export the character then definitely turn it off okay now let's start fixing the problem areas

760
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:07,620
I'll hide the main body mesh and focus on the teeth so again I have upper teeth lower teeth and

761
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:14,540
a tongue object I'll select the upper teeth and before we fix the weights we want to make sure that

762
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:23,040
the bones that correspond to the teeth and tongue are positioned correctly so I'll go back to the rig tab

763
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:32,040
select the rig and click edit reference bones and that will give me again the reference bones or the

764
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:40,080
meta rig whatever you want to call it and you'll find the teeth bones above and below the tongue bones

765
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:46,580
so these three bones are the tongue bones this is the central teeth bone and this is the right

766
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:52,760
teeth bone and this is the left upper teeth bone why do we have left and right actually you don't need

767
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:59,260
to use all of them that will just allow you to bend the teeth which may be useful in cartoony characters

768
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,540
so I'm going to select the jaw bone because it is very large and it makes it hard to see what

769
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:13,200
I'm doing so selected press H and then I'll select all of these three upper teeth bones go to the side

770
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:20,480
view and place them inside the volume of the upper teeth and then from the front view I'll place the

771
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:27,440
bones on the sides of the teeth of the upper teeth same thing for the lower teeth just select these three

772
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:35,420
bones they're called teeth bottom ref from the side view place them around here from the front

773
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:42,180
view move them a little bit to the side and that will be it and now in object mode i'm going to

774
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:49,840
select both i'm going to hide both teeth objects and then back to the rig go to edit mode

775
00:39:53,110 --> 00:40:02,550
and move the tongue bone and move the tongue bones into position something like this so you can edit

776
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:09,130
these reference bones even after you generate the rig once and even after binding the character to

777
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:15,970
the rig this is not so much thanks to autoreg pro but thanks to blender blender is very flexible in

778
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:22,670
this regard so even at this point if i find that the shoulder is not rotating correctly i can just

779
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:28,490
grab this joint and move it around reposition it and basically change the point of rotation of the

780
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:35,290
shoulder that can be very powerful it's very cool that blender can do that so when i'm done editing

781
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:40,770
the reference bones just in case i'm going to press alt h to unhide any hidden bones this is good

782
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:51,250
practice and match the rig again now you'll see that these teeth widgets and the tongue widgets are

783
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:58,650
placed exactly where they should be so next i'll go to object mode alt h to unhide everything and then

784
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:06,630
i'll hide the main mesh so that i can see the teeth again and so i'll select this upper teeth mesh go to

785
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:13,990
the data properties and here on the vertex groups i'll just click here and choose delete all groups

786
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:21,070
so any weighting that we had on this character will be gone let's do the same for the lower teeth

787
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:32,390
and for the tongue so now if i go to the rig pose mode and move this jaw widget you'll see that it no

788
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:40,030
longer moves the teeth and the tongue when manually tweaking the weights in autoreg pro it is important to

789
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:46,930
know that the deformation bones are here on the last layer you'll see that some of them still look like

790
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:53,170
shapes not like bones you can kind of change this if you go to viewport display and disable shapes but

791
00:41:53,170 --> 00:42:01,250
it doesn't matter everything that is here on the last layer is deformation bone and on layer one and

792
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:08,610
two are the controls so when you want to work on weights go to the last layer and all other layers

793
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:13,930
These are so-called mechanism bones, they create the automations in the rig, and it's

794
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,010
best to leave them alone.

795
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:22,470
So now, to weight the teeth, I'm going to use again some of the advanced skinning options.

796
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:29,110
So I'm going to select the three teeth bones, right, center, left and right, and then go

797
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:35,130
to skinning, and disable selected vertices only, and enable selected bones only.

798
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:42,110
So now, because I have these three bones selected, AutoRig Pro will only use them for weighting.

799
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:49,650
I'll go to object mode, select the upper teeth, shift-select the rig, I'll choose voxelized,

800
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,330
and again make sure that I have this setting enabled, and click bind.

801
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:02,530
Now if I go to pose mode, and move the bones, nothing seems to happen, so I guess it failed.

802
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:09,570
Let's try to use heatmaps then, same settings, and click bind.

803
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,040
Now it's only, now it's only assigned to this bone, hum.

804
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,220
Oh, okay, I didn't have all bones selected, I just had to select all bones, and then with

805
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:32,710
heatmaps, click bind, and now you see that each bone kinda deforms the upper teeth.

806
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:38,830
And don't worry, if we enable the controls, here's this main control that moves the whole

807
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,610
upper teeth.

808
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:44,330
And most of the time you won't even move these controls, you'll just open the jaw, and then

809
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,910
everything will move automatically.

810
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:49,030
Let's keep binding, and you'll see how it works.

811
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:57,150
So select the lower teeth, shift-select the armature, enable only the last layer, go to

812
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:03,470
pose mode, select the three teeth bones, and with these same settings, click bind.

813
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:05,830
Okay.

814
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:13,530
Now if I enable the main controls, and open the jaw, the teeth will move with the jaw.

815
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,890
And here I can kinda deform the teeth.

816
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,510
Or move the whole thing.

817
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:25,110
And now we only need to take care of the tongue, which we'll do in the same way, just undo.

818
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,530
Okay, I'll hide the teeth.

819
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:37,990
Select the tongue, shift-select the rig, pose mode, enable the deform bones, hold shift while

820
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:43,270
selecting all of these three tongue bones, and with the same settings, click bind.

821
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,130
Okay.

822
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,650
Now in object mode, I can unhide everything.

823
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:54,970
Select the rig, and enable the control bones, or control shapes.

824
00:44:55,430 --> 00:45:00,770
Go to pose mode, and if I grab the jaw and move it, you'll see that it opens the mouth.

825
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,070
The teeth and tongue are also moving properly with the jaw.

826
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:09,550
If you wanna move the tongue, you can do it like this.

827
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:14,930
You can rotate these controls, you can also move them and stretch them, if that helps you

828
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:17,150
achieve the deformation that you want.

829
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:19,970
And that's it.

830
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,570
The mouth and jaw should be fixed now.

831
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,530
Now let's focus on the eye.

832
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:33,330
So it seems like the upper lid is deforming the lower lid, which is not good.

833
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,970
And also it has too much influence over the polygons above the eye.

834
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:43,790
So here we're going to be doing good old-fashioned weight painting, and I have a full playlist

835
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,090
about weight painting if you wanna learn the basics.

836
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:50,210
Here I'm going to go a little bit fast, but I'm going to tell you the most important stuff.

837
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,210
So go to object mode, and I'm going to hide the lashes again, the eyelashes.

838
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:02,770
Select the rig, and again unhide the deformation bones, and then shift-select the mesh, and

839
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,030
go to weight paint mode.

840
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,380
Right?

841
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:13,000
And you may want to click on the x-ray button here, so that you don't see the bones through

842
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,380
the mesh.

843
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:20,980
And now if I control-click, and now if I control-click on this bone, I should see what it affects,

844
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:26,920
but it looks like I have the hair selected, rather than the face.

845
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,660
So let's select the rig, shift-select the face, and then go to weight paint mode.

846
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:37,800
And if I control-click here, I'll see what parts of the mesh are affected by this shape.

847
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,720
And it may not be super obvious, but you'll see that there is a little influence on the

848
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,400
lower lid.

849
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,360
So let's go to tool, where you'll find the options for weight painting.

850
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:54,340
And here, under symmetry, I want to enable mirror vertex groups, and also the x option.

851
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:59,180
So that way, anything that I do on this side of the mesh will be mirrored on the other side,

852
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,880
and I don't have to manually paint both sides.

853
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,500
Next under option, I'm going to enable auto-normalize.

854
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,840
I always enable this option, and that saves me some trouble.

855
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,500
Please refer to the weight painting playlist if you want an in-depth explanation.

856
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:19,180
But for now, I'll set weight to zero, which means that I'll be removing weights here.

857
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:25,520
The strength I can keep to one, and with F, I'm going to make my brush a little bit bigger,

858
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:32,020
and paint on the lower lid, and make sure that all of the light blue color disappears.

859
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,580
You can also enable show zero weights.

860
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,660
And that will allow you to easily see weights that are greater than zero.

861
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:53,950
So for some reason, the mix mode didn't quite remove the weights fully.

862
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:59,610
So I'll switch to subtract mode, and set the weight to one.

863
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:07,010
So I'm fully subtracting the weights, and then click until the whole lower lid becomes black.

864
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,830
And then also ctrl-click on the next shape, and do the same.

865
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:15,590
I want to remove all influence of this bone below the upper lid.

866
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:20,750
Okay, this also affects a little bit too much of this, of the cheek.

867
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:27,950
So paint it out, similarly here.

868
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:34,590
Let's see the angle, and I'll keep erasing the weights.

869
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,850
Okay, let's see the bones on the lower lid.

870
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,670
So again, I don't want them to affect the upper lid at all.

871
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:49,550
And also, I'm going to erase the weights that go too far down.

872
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,960
Okay, something like this.

873
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,560
And then again, I'll go through the bones on the upper lid.

874
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:07,380
And I'm going to reduce the strength of the subtraction, and I want to remove the influence

875
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,160
of this bone over the brow, basically.

876
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,020
Okay, same with this bone.

877
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:21,700
Reduce the strength, and try to erase the weights, so that it only affects this part of

878
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,460
the upper lid.

879
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,060
Okay, so I think this may be starting to work now.

880
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:36,600
So let's go to object mode, select the rig, unhide the controls, go to pause mode, and

881
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,520
try to close the eye.

882
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,580
And you'll see that it's much better.

883
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,300
It doesn't affect the lower lid.

884
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,460
But it looks like the central bone is affecting the sides too much.

885
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:53,440
So let's close the eye, shift select the mesh, and go to weight paint mode again.

886
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,060
Control click on this central bone.

887
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,480
And I'm still in subtract mode.

888
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,260
So I'll try to subtract some of these weights from the sides.

889
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:13,960
And also subtract the weights that the edge of the eye has on these eyelids.

890
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:42,870
And now I'll switch back to mix, and with these same settings, weight to 1 and strength

891
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:50,530
to something low, I'm going to try to click in this area to make these vertices more affected

892
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:51,170
by this bone.

893
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,600
So it's almost there, I just don't really like the outer edge of the eye.

894
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:11,980
So again, select the rig, shift select the mesh, weight paint mode, and I guess this bone

895
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:15,520
shouldn't be affecting the upper lid that much.

896
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:21,840
So let's go back to subtract mode, and subtract these weights.

897
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,500
Also it goes too far into the temples.

898
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:30,940
So now I can control click on this control and try to close the eye again.

899
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:40,430
Let's try to paint some weights for this central bone over here on the side of the lid.

900
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:46,490
So mix mode, low strength, and I'll paint just a little bit.

901
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:55,740
Okay, so the solution was actually to paint some weights for the edge of the eye on the

902
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,760
side of the eyelid.

903
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:03,180
I'll go back to object mode, and now my eye is closing reasonably well.

904
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,100
You can keep painting the weights, this process can be very time consuming, but you can get

905
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,000
even better results.

906
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,820
Another tool that you can use is the blur tool.

907
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,640
And I'm going to call this one done for now.

908
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,740
So another problem area that you may encounter are the eyelashes.

909
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,300
I'm going to press Alt H to unhide them.

910
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,600
Here they are.

911
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,140
And now if I close, you'll see that they don't really follow the eyelids.

912
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:44,940
So here is a very powerful technique that you can use, not only for eyelashes, but

913
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,160
it will help in this case.

914
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,700
I'm going to delete all groups for these eyelashes.

915
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:58,520
I want to set the weights anew, and I'll go to the modifiers and add a data transfer modifier.

916
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,220
I'll move it above the armature modifier.

917
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:07,700
And then as a source, I'm going to use the picker and choose the body or the face mesh.

918
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:13,880
Then I'm going to enable vertex data, and in the options, vertex groups.

919
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,200
And then press the generate data layers button.

920
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,260
So now if I go back to the data properties, you'll see that we have the vertex groups again.

921
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:30,600
But now if I go to my rig and go to pose mode and move the eyelid a little bit, you'll see

922
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,540
that now the eyelash is trying to move with the eyelid, but not quite.

923
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:38,520
So that is because this modifier is live.

924
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,900
So as I'm moving the control, this modifier is being updated.

925
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,620
To avoid that, I want to apply the modifier.

926
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,160
So click this triangle and choose apply.

927
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:56,540
Now if I go to the rig and move the eyelid, you'll see that the behavior is different.

928
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,340
It's still not perfect.

929
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:04,060
That is because the transfer didn't quite propagate to the end of the eyelid.

930
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,740
I'm going to enable bioframe.

931
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,800
So the eyelash mesh is kind of big.

932
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,900
Here is its end actually, over here.

933
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:16,400
And so now we're going to have to do a little bit of additional weight painting.

934
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:19,440
So select the rig, shift select the eyelash.

935
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,660
And actually, I'll go to edit mode and press L, and then L one more time on the other side

936
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,040
to select the upper eyelashes.

937
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,980
Press P and separate them into a separate object.

938
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,540
So this is again the power of Blender.

939
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:37,760
It allows us to separate and join objects, and the weights just stay together.

940
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:44,680
By separating these meshes, I don't have to worry that I'll be painting on the lower

941
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,900
eyelash, and I can just focus on the upper one.

942
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:54,300
So select the rig, shift select the eyelash, weight paint mode, and now I'm going to control

943
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,740
click on this here, which is the control of the upper eyelid.

944
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,760
And I can try to blur, I guess, a little bit.

945
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,360
But yeah, I'll have to paint.

946
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,220
So blend mix, weight to 1, and strength to something low.

947
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,960
And I'm going to paint at the top of the eyelash.

948
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:23,580
Okay, then select this control here, and paint some weights, and this control, and paint some

949
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,340
weights over here.

950
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:33,380
And then maybe the edge, and paint some weights, and then I'll blur a little bit, but not too

951
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:33,620
much.

952
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:39,640
So I guess I have to paint a little bit more here at the top.

953
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:49,890
Okay, and now we're getting something that is working.

954
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:54,410
I can both go back to the rig and test the behavior.

955
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:58,010
And yeah, I can work with that.

956
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:00,470
With more painting, it can get even better.

957
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,710
It just takes time.

958
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:03,950
So take your time with the weight painting.

959
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:10,390
And in the end, maybe, let's maybe fix this problem here.

960
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:13,590
So just create this pose where the problem is visible.

961
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:20,470
Go to object mode, shift select the mesh, go to weight paint mode, and control click

962
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,970
on a deforming bone.

963
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:28,470
So if I enable x-ray here, I can see the bones better.

964
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:31,750
I want to select the lower leg bone.

965
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:39,510
And then if I disable overlays, and just use the blur brush and blur a little bit,

966
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:44,250
you'll see that we basically fix the problem with just a little bit of blurring.

967
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:50,050
And if we move around, we may find additional problems.

968
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:56,330
And you can keep blurring or try a little bit of painting, and it should become perfect.

969
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:02,230
So I hope you enjoyed this full workflow with AutoRig Pro.

970
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:05,930
We did spend some time on fixing weight painting issues.

971
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:12,810
This is very normal, AutoRig Pro does help a lot, but some manual work is unavoidable.

972
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:18,750
And I wanted to make sure that you'll have all of the necessary tools to rig your first character

973
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,010
with AutoRig Pro.
